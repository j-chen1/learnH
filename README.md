#### By: Jenny Chen

This github repository contains the code which implements the Hamiltonian learning algorithm for a single qubit outlined in Huang et al.'s paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.03030). Please navigate [here](./notebook.ipynb) in order to access the code and corresponding simulations which were executed and used in the paper.
